# Book recommender
### Book Recommender Capstopne Project for Springboard Data Science Career Track

This Python script uses a dataset containing six million ratings and tags for the ten thousand most popular books. It requests the user to enter books that he or she has read and the rating that was given on a scale 1 - 5, also tags that may be of interest. 

The engine uses the user's input and compares it to other readers in a database containing over 53,000 readers with ratings of 10,000 books.

The data was obtained from Kaggle which in turn is based on the well-known goodreads.com website. 

This script was developed using Python and SKLearn machine learning libraries for cosine similarity.
